# Obstacle-detection-using-RADAR-and-Ultrasonic-sensor
Developed a real-time obstacle detection and speed estimation system using ESP32, HB100 radar sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and LM324 op-amp for signal amplification. The system detects stationary and moving 
objects within threshold values, calculates their speed in cm/s, triggers buzzer,displays distance and speed data on LCD.
